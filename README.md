# OffMyChest-App
A web application that allows users to join into a community/post area with a given random user ID and create a post about anything. Users can also interact with posts as well. This app was made using PHP mainly, with some jQuery and AJAX. I also used MySQL for the database. The main purpose for this app was to learn how AJAX operates with PHP and getting used to SQL statements. If this app was going to be published for actual use, there would need to be more things done to it such as error checking, user restrictions, etc. But it was just a learning experience and I enjoyed it!

It's also responsive so it works on mobile devices!
