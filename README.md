# OffMyChest-App
A web application that allows users to join into a community/post area with a given random user id, and post things that other users can relate to or assist with. There's a few things that could be changed if it was going to be an app on the web, but for the most part this was just to learn mysqli, database calls, updates, etc. The app is responsive so it works on mobile as well.
